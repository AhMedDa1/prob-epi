# About this course

This online book consists of lecture notes of the course which I taught during 

-  25 March to 12 April 2024 to the inaugural cohort, 
- 25 November to 13 December 2024 to the second cohort

of MSc ["AI for Science"](https://ai.aims.ac.za/) at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)](https://aims.ac.za/), South Africa. 


The title of the course for the first cohort was **"Bayesian Modelling and Probabilistic Programming with Numpyro and examples from Epidemiology''**.

The title of the course for the second cohort is **"Bayesian Modelling with Numpyro and Deep Generative Surrogates for Epidemiology''**.

## Abstract

In this course we will explore a range of topics in Bayesian modelling, such as Bayesian inference, hierarchical modelling, Gaussian processes for spatial statistics, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and agent-based models (ABMs) for disease transmission modelling. 

Using the probabilistic programming language `Numpyro`, we will construct probabilistic models and perform Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty in model predictions and parameter estimates. 

As the course progresses, we will introduce <span style="color:orange">deep generative models</span> as efficient surrogates for computationally demanding model components (yes, this is 'generative AI'!). These surrogates, implemented in `JAX`, will be integrated seamlessly into Numpyro programs, enabling fast and scalable MCMC inference. 

While the course emphasises computational techniques, the models and applications are rooted in real-world epidemiology, providing a practical framework for data-driven decision-making in health research.


## Prerequisites

- Conditional probability
- Joint probability
- Marginal distribution
- Python: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

## Evaluation

Throughout the course, you will see a set of `Tasks` in the lecture notes. You need to submit answers to all of the tasks in one executable file (link to a Colab document or an `.ipynb`).

```{margin}
`Tasks` are to be solved individually and submitted. `Group tasks` are to be discussed with your peers during the class.
