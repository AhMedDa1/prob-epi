        "We consider a random realization of a point process $S=\\{s_1, \\dots ,s_n\\}$ - a <font color='orange'>point pattern</font> in a study region $D$. The aim of point patterns analysis is to discover the underlying process based on the generated events $S$. Both the number of events $n$ and their locations $S$ are random. Point processes are characterized by their first- and second- order properties. First-order properties, such as <font color='orange'>intensity function</font>, measure the distribution of events in a study region. Second-order properties measure the tendency of events to appear clustered, independently, or regularly-spaced. The intensity function $\\lambda(s)$ represents the non-normalized location probability density and sums up to the expectation of the total number of points within the study region $D$: \n",
