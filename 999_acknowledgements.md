# Acknowledgements, links and literature

## Acknowledgements and links
- AIMS-SA and Ulrich Paquet personally for the invitation. Being invited to teach at AIMS is a privelege!
- The students of the first cohort of the "AI for Science" Masters at AIMS South Africa. Out of 31 students, 28 opted to take the course. Plus, 13 students from Stellenbosch joined remotely. I value your trust! 
- [Machine Learning and Global Health](mlgh.net/people) network for many things, but in  particular for the (virtual, at the time) space where I learnt Numpyro through a reading group together with some MLGH members: Swapnil Mishra, Iwona Hawryluk, Tim Wolock, Theo Rashid, Giovanni Charles.
- [Deep Learning Indaba](https://deeplearningindaba.com/) for showing me how much ML enthisuams there is on the African continent and making me want to contribute 
- Co-authors of the paper [Bayesian workflow for disease transmission modeling in Stan](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.9164) and all particiapnts of the regular Thursday Stan call which enabled me to co-author.
- Lorenzo Ciardo from Kellogg College at Oxford for telling me about the Buffon's needle problem.
- Richard McEarlth for posting the [prior-likelihood conflict example](https://twitter.com/rlmcelreath/status/1701165075493470644)
- Darren Wilkinson for the brilliant GP visualisation idea which he's been presenting for years at GPSS.
- Previous workshops on which I tought and which served as a basis fort this extended course: 
    - [AMLD 2020 workshop](https://github.com/elizavetasemenova/EmbracingUncertainty) "Bayesian Inference: embracing uncertainty" with Julia + Turing.jl, R + Stan and Python+PyMC3.
    - [Nordic ProbAI 2022](https://probabilistic.ai/) lecture on Bayesian workflow.
- Kira Duesterwald and James Allingham for writing together the [DLI-23](https://github.com/deep-learning-indaba/indaba-pracs-2023) practical, which is used in the chapter on probability distributions and random variables.
- Stan Lazic, whose reflections on his book writing experience made me realise that I, most likely, don't want to extend these lecture notes to a book - too time consuming :) 
- [STPH](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/) where my own journey into Bayesian inference and spatial statistics began.
- Imperial College London, [Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health/epidemiology-and-biostatistics/) department who recently hired me as a lecturer providing me with an opportunity to stay in academia and research for the long term.
